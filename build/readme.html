<h1 id="rebelchef">Rebel Chef</h1>

<h3 id="initialweblaunch">Initial Web Launch</h3>

<hr />

<p>This is the Rebel Chef static site, built completely with my new love, the (BULMA)[http://www.bulma.io] Framework, I honestly had no idea where this has been all my Bootstrappin' days. Although I did convert it from SASS to SCSS I&#8217;m still really digging it.</p>

<p>I also built the HTML out using PUG/JADE templates. These <strong>kick ass</strong> plain and simple. Along with a few other goodies like IONIC ICONS, Zen Scroll, jQuery and some custom Javascript this project was a dream!</p>

<p>Which is why I would also highly recommend (CodeKit)[http://www.codekit.io] to any macOS devs out there dealing with a task runners like Gulp and Bower. CodeKit makes it a breeze.</p>

<h3 id="whatimworkingwith">What I&#8217;m Working With</h3>

<hr />

<p>This project basically made me realize I don&#8217;t need a ton of components. I&#8217;m starting to build out my own stack/framework/starting point.</p>

<ul>
<li>Animate.css</li>
<li>Bulma</li>
<li>Bulma Extensions

<ul>
<li>Carousel</li>
<li>Page Loader</li>
</ul></li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>PUG</li>
<li>SASS/SCSS</li>
<li>Sweet Alert 2</li>
<li>ZenScroll</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I&#8217;m currently looking to start working with a team of <em>passionate individuals</em> or <em>simply work one-on-one with a motivated client.</em> I&#8217;d love to hear about your latest idea, and where you think I&#8217;d be a good fit! I&#8217;m typically hired for positions anywhere on the spectrum from conceptual to technical. I have been hired as a UX Designer and I have been hired as a Front-End Developer. I also have extensive experience evangelizing ideas and selling great solutions.</p>

<p>The web is ever changing. Your business must adapt or you will, without a doubt, one day soon find that your business lacks everything it needs to properly keep its current business engaged and <em>everything else</em> needed to properly harness new streams of revenue.</p>

<p>Without a clear understanding of the current digital landscape, <em>failure is likely</em> and <em>severe underperformance is your new significant other.</em></p>

<li><em>Consulting</em></li>
