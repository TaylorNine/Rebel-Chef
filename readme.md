# Rebel Chef 
### Initial Web Launch
----
This is the Rebel Chef static site, built completely with my new love, the  (BULMA)[http://www.bulma.io] Framework, I honestly had no idea where this has been all my Bootstrappin' days. Although I did convert it from SASS to SCSS I'm still really digging it. 

I also built the HTML out using PUG/JADE templates. These **kick ass** plain and simple. Along with a few other goodies like IONIC ICONS, Zen Scroll, jQuery and some custom Javascript this project was a dream!

Which is why I would also highly recommend (CodeKit)[http://www.codekit.io] to any macOS devs out there dealing with a task runners like Gulp and Bower. CodeKit makes it a breeze. 


### What I'm Working With
----
This project basically made me realize I don't need a ton of components. I'm starting to build out my own stack/framework/starting point. 

- Animate.css
- Bulma
- Bulma Extensions
    - Carousel
    - Page Loader
- jQuery
- PUG
- SASS/SCSS
- Sweet Alert 2
- ZenScroll

I'm currently looking to start working with a team of _passionate individuals_ or _simply work one-on-one with a motivated client._ I'd love to hear about your latest idea, and where you think I'd be a good fit! I'm typically hired for positions anywhere on the spectrum from conceptual to technical. I have been hired as a UX Designer and I have been hired as a Front-End Developer. I also have extensive experience evangelizing ideas and selling great solutions. 

The web is ever changing. Your business must adapt or you will, without a doubt, one day soon find that your business lacks everything it needs to properly keep its current business engaged and *everything  else* needed to properly harness new streams of revenue. 

Without a clear understanding of the current digital landscape, _failure is likely_ and _severe underperformance is your new significant other._
